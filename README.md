# memory-allocator
This repository holds the source code for memory allocator. The idea for the project is taken from OSTEP https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects. However, OSTEP does not contain a description for this project. There are several tutorials I can recommend:

1) http://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/ . This is a simple version of the memory allocator that does not include memory alignment, block splitting, and block merges. Be careful, the code is not quite correct while the ideas themselves are still correct. For example
```
void *malloc(size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  // TODO: align size?

  if (size <= 0) {
    return NULL;
  }
  ...
```
**size** parameter has **size_t** type. **size_t** is unsigned integer type. Therefore **size** cannot take values less than 0, which results incorrect condition **size <= 0**. 

2) https://wiki-prog.infoprepa.epita.fr/images/0/04/Malloc_tutorial.pdf . This is a good tutorial, although the presentation of individual ideas seemed a bit abstruse to me.
## What is in this allocator?
Conceptually, my memory allocator is similar to the two presented above, but there are differences:
1) I forcibly align headers( where the information about the allocated block is stored) and memory blocks along an 8-byte boundary. Thus, if the user requests for example 3 bytes, the allocator will return 8 (although the user will not know about it). In my system, header alignment is optional, the **gcc** aligns the header to an 8-byte alignment by default. Alignment is mainly intended for compatibility with 32-bit systems, where the **size_t** type and pointer are taken 4 bytes.
2) I used **best fit** strategy instead of **first fit** when searching for a free block, but I added one feature: if we find a block exactly the right size, we immediately return it.  Thus, with a certain probability, we will not have to go through the entire list. The splitting and merging of blocks are available in this allocator.
3) Allocator is presumably thread-safe (some additional checks may be required).
## How to use this allocator?
To compile: **gcc -shared -fPIC wallocator.c -o liballoc.so** 

I suggest the following procedure:

**cpp -v /dev/null -o /dev/null** (this trick is taken from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path) to know search path in your system.

We are interested in the following lines(the output may differ in your system):
```
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
 /usr/include
 ```
I suggest using **/usr/local/include** to keep header file(**wallocator.h**). You will need to be a superuser to move the file to this directory. After that, you can
```
#include <wallocator.h>
```
in your programs.

But the work is not finished yet. The next step is to move **liballoc.so**. Similar to the previous step I suggest using **/usr/local/lib** to keep the library.

The following actions are necessary( I do not know the exact details of each linux distribution, so I am only giving an assumed set of actions ):

1) Check **/etc/ld.so.conf** for ```  include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf  ```  line. If line exist then go to the next step. If no then put one line in it: 
 ``` /usr/local/lib ``` and skip steps 2-4.

2) Check **/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf**. If file contains  ``` /usr/local/lib  ``` line then no additional work is required. Skip steps 3-4.

3) If **libc.conf** file is not exist or not contain  ``` /usr/local/lib ```  line then check other files in this directory for ``` /usr/local/lib ```. if successful, skip next step.
4) If no file in the directory contains the searched line, then create a file with the **.conf** extension and put one line in it: ``` /usr/local/lib ```.
5) Type **sudo ldconfig** command.

Now we are ready to use the library in our programs. For example, let's take the **Ex1.c** program from the **Tests** directory. 

To compile: **gcc -o Ex1 Ex1.c -lalloc**.

What is **-lalloc**? Basically it's **-llibrary** linker option. **-l** is an option followed by the name of our library without a **lib** prefix and **.so** extension. For more details type **man gcc** then **/-llibrary**.

Let's make sure we are using **liballoc.so** in our program. Type **ldd ./Ex1**.( **ldd** prints the shared objects (shared libraries) required by each program or shared object specified on the command line).

The output will be something like this:
```
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd615d3000)
    liballoc.so => /usr/local/lib/liballoc.so (0x00007f0f131a2000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f0f12fb0000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0f131c3000)
```
Good, now let's run the program. Type **./Ex1**.

Here's how the program works on my system:
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter the initialization value: 3

3 3 3 3 3
Enter the number of elements (<1 to quit): 0
Done.
```
## Why am I not using LD_PRELOAD?
If you have already looked at the source code, you probably noticed that there are no **malloc** , **calloc** , **realloc** and **free** functions. 
Instead, there are similar functions prefixed **w**. To be honest, I tried to use **malloc** , **calloc** , **realloc** and **free**, but ran into problems:

1) **ldd** prints the shared objects (shared libraries) required by each program and then issues segmentation fault. I do not know why this error occurs. An attempt to find a solution in Google was unsuccessful. By the way, the allocator from http://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial / also has similar problems on my system (even worse, **ldd** prints only a segmentation fault, no shared libraries are printed).
2) Many programs written by me really worked, but trying to run linux executable programs often led to failure. For example, here is the output for **ls -l**:
```
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 560: dl_open_worker: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args->nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!
```
output for **man ls**:
```
man: can't add seccomp rule: Invalid argument
```
although **head wallocator.c** works correctly:
```
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include "wallocator.h"

pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void * wmalloc(size_t size)
```
For the sake of interest, I tried to run **danluu's** allocator on my system. The result is absolutely the opposite: none of my programs work (a segmentation fault appears when starting the program), although linux executable programs work correctly.

So I decided not to use the standard library functions replacement approach and instead just offer alternative functions to work with a heap that you can use in your programs.

## Tests directory
I provide some test examples in **Tests** directory. **Ex1.c** , **Ex2.c** , **Ex3.c** are modified source code for exercises **12-8**, **12-9** , **17-1** from *C Primer Plus* by *Stephen Prata*. **wzip.c** and **pzip.c** are modified source code for my projects from https://github.com/shega1992/Unix-Utilities. 

How to use **Ex1.c** , **Ex2.c** , **Ex3.c** was previously explained in  ***'How to use this allocator?'*** section.
